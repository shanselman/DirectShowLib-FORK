A translation of the DirectShow PlayCap program to show how this would
appear in c#.

This application creates a preview window for the first video capture device 
that it locates on the user's system (if any). It demonstrates a simple 
example of using the ICaptureGraphBuilder2 and ICreateDevEnum interfaces 
to build a capture graph.
